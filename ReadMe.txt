    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Milkdrop XMBC	
========================================================================

The sample of interest is based on Milkdrop XMBC standalone (google this)
An eye candy program originally for winamp.

The code was written in Direct X 9, however I have tried to use my direct 3d
wrapper to wrap up all the Direct3D. The wrapper code is contained in a root folder
named DIS (for display) and this project was an experiement that took 2 weeks to write.
At the time I did not realize that Wine (windows on linux) has a perfect wrapper for 
Direct3D and that the program was pointless. 

There is still a bug in the ping pong render surfaces.
